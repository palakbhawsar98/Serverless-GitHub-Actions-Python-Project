# 🚀 Automating AWS Lambda Deployment with GitHub Actions & Serverless Framework

This project demonstrates how to **automate the deployment of AWS Lambda functions** using **GitHub Actions** and the **Serverless Framework**. AWS Lambda enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, making it a powerful tool for building serverless applications. However, manual deployments can be tedious and error-prone.

By automating the deployment process, we can:
- Save time and reduce human errors
- Ensure consistent, repeatable deployments
- Enable rapid iteration with continuous delivery
